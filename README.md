# The Multi-Agent Arcade Learning Environment


## Overview

This is a fork of the [Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)](https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment). It is mostly backwards compatible with ALE and it also supports certain games with 2 and 4 players.

To install it in Python, please use `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Multi-Agent-ALE.git
cd ./Multi-Agent-ALE
python setup.py install`

Note: Some Linux distributions may require manual installation of `cmake`, `swig`, or `zlib1g-dev` (e.g., `sudo apt install cmake swig zlib1g-dev`)
